# EasyQuiz

EasyQuiz is a simple quiz application built using Python. It allows users to create and answer questions in a quiz format.

## Features
- Create custom quizzes
- Answer questions
- Track score

## Installation

Before running the application, make sure you have Python installed. If not, you can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing Dependencies

To install the required dependencies for the project, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Creating Executable
If you want to generate an executable .exe file to easily run the application without Python, you can use PyInstaller to package the application.

Run this command to create the executable:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile main.py

This will generate a single executable file in the dist folder.

### Usage
Running the Application
Option 1: Using the executable
After building the .exe file with PyInstaller, navigate to the dist folder inside your project directory.
Inside the dist folder, you will find the EasyQuiz.exe file.
You can double-click the EasyQuiz.exe file to run the application.
Option 2: Using the Python script
If you prefer to run the Python script directly, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python main.py
Directory Structure
The directory structure of the project is as follows:

```bash
easyquiz/
│
├── main.py                # The main Python script for the application
├── requirements.txt       # List of dependencies
└── dist/                  # Folder containing the executable (after building with PyInstaller)
